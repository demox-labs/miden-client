/**
 * Rollup configuration file for building a Cargo project and creating a WebAssembly (WASM) module,
 * as well as bundling a dedicated web worker file.
 *
 * The configuration sets up three build processes:
 *
 * 1. **WASM Module Build:**
 *    Compiles Rust code into WASM using the @wasm-tool/rollup-plugin-rust plugin. This process
 *    applies specific cargo arguments to enable necessary WebAssembly features (such as atomics,
 *    bulk memory operations, and mutable globals) and to set maximum memory limits. For testing builds,
 *    the WASM optimization level is set to 0 to improve build times, reducing the feedback loop during development.
 *
 * 2. **Worker Build:**
 *    Bundles the dedicated web worker file (`web-client-methods-worker.js`) into the `dist/workers` directory.
 *    This configuration resolves WASM module imports and uses the copy plugin to ensure that the generated
 *    WASM assets are available to the worker.
 *
 * 3. **Main Entry Point Build:**
 *    Resolves and bundles the main JavaScript file (`index.js`) for the primary entry point of the application
 *    into the `dist` directory.
 *
 * Each build configuration outputs ES module format files with source maps to facilitate easier debugging.
